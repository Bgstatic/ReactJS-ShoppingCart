 ## About the App
 
 A basic shopping cart app that where you can add items to cart or filter the products based on their features. This a preview of the app, I will make it more useful for the later projects like e-commerce etc. Main idea of the project is that make a shopping cart functional and learn the logic of the cart. I inspired from [Amazon's](https://www.amazon.com/) style for the app.
